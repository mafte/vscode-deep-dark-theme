# Deep Dark Color Theme

The Deep Dark Color theme is a meticulous design from scratch, employing a careful combination of dark blues to achieve visual coherence and focus specifically on what matters most: the code. It is based on the code highlighting palette of [One Dark Pro](https://binaryify.github.io/OneDark-Pro), which is fantastic; only a few adjustments were made to refine the experience.

## Variations

The theme was originally conceived with a palette of blue colors as a starting point, along with accent colors designed to enhance overall accessibility. This serves as the foundation for other variations, although it's possible that not all of them are fully optimized.
